# LeCompteEstBon
The famous game from "Des chiffres et des lettres".


## Purpose

> "**Le Compte Est Bon**" is a really funny game, where you have to get a number (100-999), from 6 others numbers (1-10, 25, 50, 75, 100).

> You only may do the following operations : ( + - * / ), and you can only have positive integers. Finally, each number may be used once at most.

> You have to get to the given number, or the closest you can.

I've always tried to search for the solution, but I needed to be sure that at list one exists.
The solver I wrote aims to find the solution, or the closest one.

## Kotlin

I've also heard a bit about [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/ "Official page"). The whole project will be coded only in Kotlin.

It's the first time I use Kotlin, but it looks really promising.
